@@description
<p>Umple has a special directive that allows you to highlight certain elements (currently only classes) in UmpleOnline and GraphViz output. Simply write 'displayColor xxx;' in a class where xxx is any html colour such as "red" or "#BBCCFF". UK spelling displayColour also works.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords">valid set of colors can be found online at the W3C official site</a>.</p>
