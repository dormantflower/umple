<h2>Umple warning  reported when a use statement refers to a file that cannot be loaded.</h2>

<p>
The argument to a use statement must be a valid .ump file found in the same directory as the file with the use statement, or in its parent directory, or in a subdirectory named lib. It can also be a builtin Umple library file (prefixed by lib:) or an https URL pointing to an umple file on the Internet.
</p>

<p>Check the spelling of the filename, and check file permissions.</p>
