a system you would use one or more of the following tools to view, edit 
and compile .ump files.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>UmpleOnline.</b> <a href="https://try.umple.org">UmpleOnline</a> 
allows you to instantly experiment with Umple on the web. You can explore 
examples or create your own and save them in the "cloud". You can generate 
code as well as several other outputs. <a href="UsingUmpleOnline.html">The UmpleOnline
section of this User manual describes how to use UmpleOnline</a>. Note that UmpleOnline
can be run locally on your machine by using a Docker image. <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/umple/umpleonline/">See the DockerHub page for information.</a></li>

<li><b>Eclipse.</b> To use Umple with Eclipse, you need to load an Umple 
Eclipse plugin. This can be obtained from our <a

<li><b>Command-line based compiler</b> You can always use Umple from the 
command line, typically from an ant script. Simply <a

officially released version of the umple jar</a>, and run it as "java -jar umple.jar *.ump".  A shell script called umple is also available in the dev-tools directory to make the preceding easier. The dev-tools directory also has other tools to automated useful tasks for building and using Umple. Additionally you can download and install the Umple jar file and the umple shell script using chocolatey (Windows), or brew (Mac). </li>
