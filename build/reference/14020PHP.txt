<p>
The PHP generator supports all class diagramming features of Umple, and generates code that is fully tested.</p>

<p>PHP code can be embedded in Umple, and Umple can generate PHP features such as classes, attributes and associations. This can save a lot of boilerplate programming for systems with complex class structures. The generated PHP code can then be combined with other PHP code written separately.</p>

<p>State machines are not yet fully supported in PHP</p>
