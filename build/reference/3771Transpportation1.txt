@@tooltip This is an example of a high level pattern that can be re-used to create transporation systems for different vehicle types.

@@description
<p>Transportation systems for airlines, bus networks and train networks have many things in common. This is a high level pattern to capture one way of representing common features of those models.</p>

<p>The pattern consists of traits representing
 <ul>
   <li>Generic Routes with an ID
   <li>RegularlyScheduledRun on those routes
   <li>ActualRun (occurrences) of the above
   <li>ScheduledStop
   <li>Vehicles used
 </ul</p>
</p>

<p>This is only one possible design for a transportation system, but it illustrates some possibilities. The two examples show how the design has been applied to create an airline system and a bus system.</p>

<p>Experiment with the diagrams in UmpleOnline. You can use control-G and Control-E to switch layout; you can use control-R to toggle between viewing traits or collapsed classes.</p>
