<p>
The Java generator is the most full-featured of all the Umple code generators.</p>

<p>Java code can be embedded in Umple, and Umple can generate Java from all its modeling features.</p>

<p>Java code can be executed in UmpleOnline if one or more of the classes has a main method. UmpleOnline guards against compile-time and run-time Java errors when executing code. It provides feedback about the relevant line of code where any error occurs.</p>

<p>The Umple compiler itself is written in Umple with embedded Java, and the Java generator is then used to generate the compiler. All Umple features are supported by this generator
