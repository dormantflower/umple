@@description
<p>
A composite state table is a state table which, instead of displaying single states and their transitions, displays a combination of multiple concurrent states. They are generated as part of the state table generation.
</p>

<p>
They can be generated in UmpleOnline through "TOOLS > GENERATE > State Tables" and clicking "Generate It".
</p>

<p>
They can also be generated through the command-line with "java -jar umple.jar -g StateTables *.ump".
