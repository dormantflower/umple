<p>
The Python generator in Umple allows you to embed Python code in Umple. Almost everything that can be generated by the Umple Java generator is also available:  TXL transformation technology is used to convert generated Java to Python.</p>

<p>The Python generator also works on the command line, but if you are generating Python on the command line you need to install <a target="txl" href="https://www.txl.ca">version 10.8b of FreeTXL</a> first.</p>

<p>To create a Main function, follow the the last two <a href="HelloWorldExamples.html">Hello World examples</a> for some tips. Specify <code>public static void main(String [ ] args) {  </code> followed on subsequent lines by Python code, followed by a <code>}</code></li>

<p>Currently Python code cannot be executed in UmpleOnline.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Currently Partially supported features:
<ul>
    <li>Aspect oriented code Injection (before and after methods).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br><br>

<p>
Currently unsupported features:
<ul>
    <li>Tracing: This is very Java-specific.</li>
    <li>Any Umple code that see creates synchronized methods in Java: See issue #2070 and #2071 for more information</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
If any of the features that are supported appear to function incorrectly, please submit <a target="newissue" href="https://github.com/umple/umple/issues/new">a new issue here</a>.
